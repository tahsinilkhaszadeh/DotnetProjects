**About the Repository**

This repository is a collection of sample projects created using .NET to demonstrate various programming concepts, best practices, and features of the framework. 
It's designed to help junior developers like me to explore and learn.

**Acknowledgements**

I’d like to thank the .NET community for inspiration and support in creating these projects. 
This repository wouldn’t be possible without the fantastic resources and feedback from fellow developers.
